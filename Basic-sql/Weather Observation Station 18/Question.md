# Weather Observation Station 18

Consider **P1(a, b)** and **P2(c, d)** to be two points on a 2D plane.
- `a` happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- `b` happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
- `c` happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
- `d` happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the **Manhattan Distance** between points `P1` and `P2` and round it to a scale of `4` decimal places.

**Input Format**

The STATION table is described as follows:

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.
